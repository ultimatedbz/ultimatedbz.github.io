1. Introduction

  Thanks for trying out Toon Cutter! This was my final project for CSE 167 Introduction to Computer Graphics. 
  We had to implement two new features not covered in class so I chose to implement object collision and toon shading.
  I also decided to use a concept known as scene graphs which was covered in a previous lecture. When I saw the list of
  features we could use, toon shading immediately caught my eye. Drawing the connection to toon link, I decided that I
  wanted him to hit something, causing me to eventually settle on object collision as the other feature.

2. Terms

  Toon Shading: A type of shading that gives 3D objects a more 2 Dimensional feel.

  Object Collision: Senses when two objects in graphical space collide.

  Scene Graphs: A programming technique that passes transformations down to children recursively. This way,
                one transformation performed on a parent node will propagate down to its children. For example,
                if I set Toonlink's head to be the parent of his body, and his body the parent of his arms and 
                legs, then I can translate the head 5 units up, and his whole body, arms, and legs will also 
                translate upwards by 5 units.

3. How to Run

  Open up the terminal and cd to the ToonCutter directory. Then execute the command "./ToonCutter"

4. How to use 

  In Toon Cutter, you have control of the bomb and Toonlink.

  Keyboard:

    B - Switch control between the bomb and Toonlink

    M - Toggle Hit Boxes

    R - Reset everything to starting position

    T - Toggle Toon Shading

    x, y, z - Move bomb/toonlink in negative x, y, or z direction

    X, Y, Z - Move bomb/toonlink in positive x, y, or z direction

  Mouse:

    Left Click - Rotate around center of screen

    Right Click - Translate up and down
